# Frontend Developer Technical Test

This task is designed to evaluate your skills in **React**, **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **animation libraries** such as **GSAP** or **Framer Motion**. You will build a small application that fetches data from a public API and presents it with engaging animations and a responsive UI.

## Project Requirements

### Tech Stack:
- **React with Next.js**
- **Typescript**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** for animations

### Features to Implement:
1. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., [Free Test API](https://freetestapi.com/apis)).
2. Display a list of fetched data on the home page in a structured and user-friendly way.
3. Add filtering or searching functionality to allow users to refine the list based on a specific criterion.
4. Provide a detail page for each item in the list (using Next.js dynamic routes). On this page, fetch and display additional data related to the item.
5. Implement at least two different types of animations using **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** (e.g., on element appearance, interaction, or transitions).

### Extra Points:
- Implement loading states for the API calls (e.g., spinners or skeleton loaders).
- Deploy the application (e.g., using **Vercel**) and provide a link.

## Getting Started

To get started, fork this repository and clone it to your local environment. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed, and then install the dependencies as you need.

Refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information on how to work with Next.js or the README.md file for the project setup.
